 You are an expert curriculum planner.
 Create a progressive **learning roadmap in STRICT JSON** format using the schema below.
 Use only the **Spring Boot topics I provided below** to build the assignment and tasks.
 JSON Schema
 json
 {
   "assignment": { "t": "", "desc": "", "d": "" },
   "tasks": [
     {
       "t": "",
       "desc": "",
       "subtopics": [],
      "points": 0,
      "color": "",
       "d": "",
       "order": 0
     }
   ]
}
 Rules
 1. Each **task title (`t`)** must be a **specific sub-topic**, not generic (e.g., instead of *Security*, write *Implementing JWT Authentication with Spring Security*).
 2. Each **description (`desc`)** must be **multi-sentence and step-based**, explaining exactly **what to study, implement, configure, or code**.
 3. Include a **subtopics array** with concrete items (annotations, frameworks, tools, configurations, patterns).
 4. Assign **realistic reward points (`points`) proportional to difficulty and effort**.
 5. Set **reasonable deadlines (`d`)** (short for small topics, longer for advanced ones).
 6. Order tasks logically (`order`), from fundamentals → intermediate → advanced → project-level.
 7. Use **color codes** (green = easy, yellow = medium, red = hard).
 8. Cover all provided Spring Boot topics **without missing any subtopic**.
